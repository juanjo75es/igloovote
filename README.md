Distributed electronic voting system.

This is a Javascript library for voting in an open election through Internet. In contrast with other voting systems, the security does not rely on a central authority. The library is open source under LGPL license with the purpose that anyone can test it, find bugs, and develop new features and improvements. However, this library is intended to be used EXCLUSIVELY in coordination with a server hosted in the domain www.igloovote.com. This server provides some authentication services, supervises some aspects of the voting process, and stores results. The source code operating in this server is not open source, The code here open sourced must be independent of whatever software is used in the server, being able to detect any misfunction of this service or any other node participating in the distributed election.
The voting system that implements this code is patent pending, so you can't implement from scratch, without the consent of the owners of the patent rights, a new version of this library without infringing these patent rights.
